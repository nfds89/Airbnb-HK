# Airbnb-HK

This repository contains a data analysis of Hong Kong's Airbnb economy.

Airbnb doesn't share raw data, the datasets used here were downloaded from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com). This scrapes the data from airbnb website and makes it publicly available. The datasets used here are from 11 July 2018.

This repository is organized as described above:
1. Data Cleaning - for a first approach on the datasets, the listings-detailed dataset is analysed and cleaned. Taking care of missing values and droping the needed outliers.
2. Data Visualization - currently under development
